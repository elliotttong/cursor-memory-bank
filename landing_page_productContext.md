# Landing Page Product Context

## Product Goal
The primary goal of the landing page is to generate a waiting list of interested individuals for an upcoming product or service. This involves:
- Clearly communicating the value proposition (even if high-level at this stage).
- Providing a simple and trustworthy mechanism for users to submit their email addresses.

## User Journey
1. User arrives at the landing page (e.g., via marketing channels, direct link).
2. User learns about the upcoming product/service.
3. User decides to join the waiting list.
4. User submits their email address through the LaunchList integration.
5. User receives confirmation (on-page or via email from LaunchList).

## Success Metrics
- Number of email sign-ups.
- Conversion rate (visitors vs. sign-ups).
- User engagement on the page (potentially measured by analytics like scroll depth, time on page if GA is configured for this).
