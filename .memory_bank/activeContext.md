# Active Context: Ready for Phase 3 Testing

**Current Mode:** BUILD (Testing - T11)
**Previous Goal:** Fix bugs related to scroll/pause/hover highlighting and document core flows.
**Outcome:** Bugs fixed, core sync/highlighting logic stabilized, documentation created/updated. Hover highlighting now works pre-playback.

**Completed Phases:**
*   Phase 1, 2, 4 (including refactoring & Bugfix T01).

**Completed Tasks:**
*   All Phase 1, 2, 4 tasks.
*   Refactoring `content.js` into `page-scripts/` modules.
*   **(Bugfix T01 & subsequent fixes):** Implement scroll/pause/hover fixes for highlights.
*   Create technical documentation (`docs/technical/`).

**Active Tasks:**
*   **(T11):** Basic testing on a few diverse sample web pages.

**Key Focus Areas:**
*   Validating core functionality (playback, all highlighting types, sync, scroll handling, pause/resume) across different website structures.

**Next Steps (Post-T11):**

1.  **(T12):** Implement simple play/pause controls (potentially refining the existing button).
2.  **(Future Task - Post T11/T12):** Implement improved hover UX (paragraph-start hover -> play button when stopped; sentence hover only when playing). Requires paragraph segmentation.
3.  **(T13 - Re-evaluate):** Review the need/priority for Offscreen Document text extraction.
4.  **(T14 - Verify):** Confirm highlighting wraps correctly and targets appropriate elements during T11 testing.
5.  **(T15):** Implement UI/logic for managing the Deep Infra API Key.
