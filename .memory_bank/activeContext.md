# Active Context: Phase 3 Testing Progress

**Current Mode:** BUILD (Phase 3 - UI/UX Focus)
**Previous Goal:** Fix bracketed text API error & investigate highlighting edge cases (BBC, Readwise).
**Outcome:** Bracketed text API error fixed. Highlighting issues (T14, Readwise) identified as complex DOM interactions and documented in `docs/limitations.md`. Investigation paused.

**Completed Phases:**
*   Phase 1, 2, 4 (including refactoring & Bugfix T01).

**Completed Tasks:**
*   All Phase 1, 2, 4 tasks.
*   Refactoring `content.js` into `page-scripts/` modules.
*   **(Bugfix T01 & subsequent fixes):** Implement scroll/pause/hover fixes for highlights.
*   Create technical documentation (`docs/technical/`).
*   **(T11 - Partial):** Fixed Service Worker Object URL issue, fixed bracketed text API error.
*   Created `docs/limitations.md`.

**Active Tasks:**
*   **(T11 - Paused):** Further testing on diverse sites paused.
*   **(T14 - Paused):** Highlighting refinement (last word issue, complex formatting) paused.
*   **(T15 - Deferred):** API Key UI/Storage deferred. Dev relies on `chrome.storage.local`. Requires backend proxy for release.

**Key Focus Areas:**
*   Remaining Phase 3 UI/UX tasks (T12, T16) or performance refactor (T13).

**Next Steps:**

1.  **(T12):** Refine play/pause button states (Playing, Paused, Loading, Error, API Key Missing).
2.  **(T16):** Implement improved hover UX (paragraph segmentation, context-aware hover).
3.  **(T13 - Re-evaluate):** Decide if Offscreen Document refactor is needed now.
