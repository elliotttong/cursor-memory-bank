# Project Brief: Chrome TTS Extension MVP

**Goal:** Create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a Chrome Extension that reads web page content aloud using the Kokoro-82M TTS model and provides synchronized word-by-word and sentence-by-sentence highlighting.

**Core Features (MVP Scope):**

1.  **TTS Integration:** Utilize Kokoro-82M for text-to-speech synthesis.
2.  **Audio Playback:** Play the generated audio within the context of the web page.
3.  **Text Highlighting:** Dynamically highlight the text being spoken at both word and sentence levels.
4.  **Synchronization:** Ensure accurate timing between audio playback and text highlighting.
5.  **Basic Activation:** Allow users to initiate reading (mechanism TBD - likely simple button/context menu initially).
