# Landing Page Tasks

## Phase 1: Initial Setup & Waitlist Integration

- [x] **VAN Mode:** Determine complexity for initial landing page setup (Completed implicitly by this setup process - Level 1/2 expected).
- [x] **PLAN Mode:** Detail tasks for Next.js setup, code integration, mobile optimization, LaunchList, and Analytics. (Plan created: `landing_page_implementation_plan.md`)
    - [x] Sub-task: Define steps to initialize a new Next.js project.
    - [x] Sub-task: Plan integration of existing landing page code into Next.js.
    - [x] Sub-task: Detail checks and changes for mobile optimization.
    - [x] Sub-task: Outline LaunchList integration steps (e.g., signup form, API keys if any).
    - [x] Sub-task: Plan Google Analytics setup (tracking ID, script placement).
    - [x] Sub-task: Define basic Vercel deployment configuration steps.
- [ ] **IMPLEMENT Mode:** Execute the planned tasks (Refer to `landing_page_implementation_plan.md`).
    - [ ] Implement 3.1: Initialize Next.js Project.
    - [ ] Implement 3.2: Integrate Existing Landing Page Code.
    - [ ] Implement 3.3: Ensure Mobile Optimization.
    - [ ] Implement 3.4: Integrate LaunchList.
    - [ ] Implement 3.5: Set Up Google Analytics.
    - [ ] Implement 3.6: Prepare for Vercel Deployment.
- [ ] **QA Mode:** Test landing page functionality.
    - [ ] Test: Verify page rendering on desktop and mobile (across multiple browsers).
    - [ ] Test: Confirm waitlist signup with LaunchList works correctly and data appears in LaunchList dashboard.
    - [ ] Test: Check Google Analytics real-time reports for page views and event tracking if any custom events are set up.
    - [ ] Test: Perform a test deployment to Vercel and verify the live URL.

## Future Considerations (Post-MVP Launch)
- [ ] Design and implement email nurturing sequences (using Resend, with data from LaunchList).
- [ ] Plan and implement migration/integration of waitlist data from LaunchList to Supabase when web app development begins.
- [ ] Explore and integrate additional analytics (e.g., Hotjar/Clarity for heatmaps).
- [ ] A/B testing for conversion optimization (if traffic volume supports it).
