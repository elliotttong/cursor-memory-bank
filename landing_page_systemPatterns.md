# Landing Page System Patterns

- **Project Structure:** Standard Next.js project structure will be followed.
- **Component Model:** React components, adhering to Next.js conventions (e.g., pages, components directory).
- **Deployment:** Automated deployments via Vercel, integrating with a Git repository.
- **Analytics Integration:** Analytics scripts (Google Analytics, etc.) will be integrated typically in the Next.js `_app.js` or `_document.js` file, or using Next.js specific features for script optimization if available and appropriate.
- **Mobile-First/Responsive Design:** Styles will be implemented to ensure a good user experience across devices, prioritizing mobile optimization.
